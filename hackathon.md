## Log

### 2026-09-05 - 78adf31
Scaffolded the repo with a README and `.gitignore`.

### 2026-09-05 - e81bb9e
Documented the Convex All Gas Hackathon requirements in the README (Convex
backend, Firecrawl data, AgentMail inbox, public repo, `convex.site`/
`chatgpt.site` hosting, Sept 22 deadline).

### 2026-09-05 - a9fc785
Installed the `convex-hackathon-skill` into `.claude/skills/` and reformatted
this log to its expected header/entry format.

### 2026-09-05 - fe806c5
Built the RegVista MVP scaffold end to end. Convex schema for `companies`,
`researchRuns`, and `findings`, each indexed `by_companyId`
(`convex/schema.ts`). `companies.ts` adds create/get/list; `research.ts` adds
a `start` mutation that schedules a research run via `ctx.scheduler` plus a
reactive `listByCompany` query and the internal mutations that record
findings and update run status. `researchActions.ts` (Node action) calls
Firecrawl's `search` for primary-source content on a company, then OpenAI
(`gpt-4.1-mini`, structured output via a Zod schema) to extract regulatory
findings, dropping any finding that isn't backed by a source URL.
`notify.ts` (Node action) sends the current findings for a company as a
briefing email through AgentMail (`client.inboxes.messages.send`). The React
frontend (`src/App.tsx`) is a company picker plus a reactive landscape view
wired to these functions via `useQuery`/`useMutation`/`useAction`. Frontend
and Convex functions both typecheck (`tsc -b`) and `vite build` succeeds;
the Firecrawl/OpenAI/AgentMail calls themselves are not yet exercised
end-to-end, which needs a live Convex deployment and API keys.
