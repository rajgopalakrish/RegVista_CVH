# RegVista — Decisions log

Newest last.

## 2026-09-05 — Adopted AGENTS.md as the working contract

Source of truth for product principle (company-centric, not RegLens),
scope discipline, and required stack. All subsequent decisions below trace
back to it.

## 2026-09-05 — Frontend stack: Vite + React + TypeScript

Chosen because it's Convex's own quickstart stack (least glue code), builds
fast, and deploys cleanly to Convex static hosting. Rejected: a heavier
meta-framework (Next.js) — unnecessary for a single-page reactive app and
adds server-rendering concerns Convex doesn't need.

## 2026-09-05 — MVP trigger is manual, not scheduled monitoring

AgentMail's "monitoring/briefing" requirement is satisfied for the MVP with
an on-demand "email me this briefing" action. Continuous scheduled
monitoring (Convex crons + diffing findings over time) is a natural v2 and
is explicitly deferred — see docs/product-spec.md "MVP scope (out)" — to
keep the hackathon build small and reliable per AGENTS.md §6/§9.

## 2026-09-05 — Data model: companies / researchRuns / findings

Three tables, no auth. A `researchRun` groups the findings produced by one
research pass so the UI can show "in progress" / "done" / "error" state
reactively instead of guessing from the presence of findings. Every
`finding` embeds its own `sources` array rather than a separate sources
table — for the MVP's scale (one company, one run at a time) a normalized
sources table would be premature.

## 2026-09-05 — Only Convex actions call external APIs

Firecrawl, OpenAI, and AgentMail calls all live in `action`/`internalAction`
functions, never in queries or mutations. This is a Convex platform
requirement (queries/mutations must be deterministic and side-effect-free)
and also keeps the untrusted-content boundary (AGENTS.md §8) in one place.

## 2026-09-05 — Use generated `env` from `convex/_generated/server`, not bare `process.env`

Node actions (`researchActions.ts`, `notify.ts`) read `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY`/`AGENTMAIL_INBOX_ID` via the `env`
object Convex's own codegen exports from `_generated/server.ts`, instead of
the bare `process` global. This avoids requiring `@types/node` in a project
that also typechecks `convex/*.ts` from the frontend's Vite project (whose
`tsconfig.app.json` has no Node lib/types) — the frontend imports
`../convex/_generated/api`, which pulls in every `convex/*.ts` file
type-only, so both projects must be able to check the same files without
Node ambient globals. This is also just the pattern Convex's generated code
itself uses.

## Open questions (not yet decided)

- Exact Firecrawl call shape (search vs. targeted crawl of known regulator
  domains) — to be settled once Firecrawl's API is inspected directly
  rather than assumed (AGENTS.md §1: prefer official docs over assumptions).
- Exact OpenAI extraction schema/model — to be pinned once implemented and
  tested against real crawled content.
